            <h1>Visual Thinking Analysis</h1>
            <h2>February 10, 2026 </h2>
            <p>Part One:</p>
            <p> My partner's images were of different colognes and scents that he and his friends use. The images showcased the label of the scent, the bottle shape, and the color of the liquid scent inside. The large colonge bottles were beautiful jewel tones, and looked like seaglass. My eye was very much drawn to the color and glassy texture of the bottles. I recommended letting the bottles stand on their own with a transparent background or white background, and also that the images be brighter. These changes would make the images more clear, detailed, and interesting.
            </p>
            <p> Part Two:</p>
            <p> The image is of the rock wall at Rocknaium, the local gym I climb at. At first, the wall just looks like a bunch of colorful random rocks. However, each type of hold has a different name, and a difficulty rating. The level of difficulty is marked by "V" and then a number, ranging from V0 to around V9 at Rocknasium. Each color represents a different route, and climbers usually have preferences for different shapes and challenge levels of certain hold. What looks like a chaotic random collection of rocks is actually carefully planned and designed to test strength and route-solving skills.</p>
            <p> For my topic, and want make it so that when you click on a rock, it shows you what the rocks name is and more information about it. I just started climbing this year, but it has already become one of my favorite things to do. I climb with friends, and the community at the gym is very supportive and motivating. Climbing challenges me both physically and mentally, which makes it such a fun workout.  </p>

            <h1>Visual Thinking Strategies Research </h1>
            <h2>February 5, 2026 </h2>
            <p> Michael Gonchar’s article, 10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills, discusses “What’s Going On?” pictures, and how they can spark conversation and creativity. I agree with the initial statement that younger generations have a difficult time focusing their attention on information that takes too long to absorb. They want a quick skim and answer, which is a problem since many important issues require more patience and focus. 

            Gonchar shows pictures of various “What’s Going On?” pictures, and describes how the pictures sparked conversations among students. Teachers noted that the image sparked debates in their classrooms, as students fought to defend their interpretations of each photo. The students were able to enhance their creative thinking and debating skills, as well as improving their ability to pay close attention to details.

            Overall, I completely relate to the experience of the students in these classrooms. I have always loved analyzing imagery, and learned so much about attention to detail and image interpretations when studying similar kinds of images in high school. Especially for younger generations that have increasingly lower and lower attention spans, learning basic observation and interpretation is important.

            <h1>Overlays Design Patter</h1>
            <h2>January 28, 2026 </h2>
            <p> In the article Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows, Baskanderi talks about how to create modal windows. I enjoyed reading this article, as it taught me a lot about how to make these elements effective and user-friendly. I first learned about a modal window, which is an element that sits on top of an application’s main window. You can use a modal window when you need to grab the user’s attention, gather user input, or show additional independent information that is not shown in the main window. The anatomy of the modal window is also very important, and it includes a shadow, a descriptive title, an escape hatch, a button label, and the size should not be too big or two small. It is also important to use a lightbox effect to darken the background when the modal window comes up, to show the users what they need to interact with. </p>

            <h1>Research Form Design</h1>
            <h2>January 17, 2026 </h2>
            <p>In the article <i>20 Best Practices for Form Design</i>, Salim Ansari discusses 20 best practices that boost a form’s usability. I thought this article was very helpful, as it solidified ideas I already understood as a user. For instance, I learned it is important to not put too many fields in a form, as it can turn viewers away from the important questions, since people don’t like filling out long forms. This has been true for me, and I am usually more drawn to forms with short questions. </p>
    
            <p>Furthermore, I learned that chunking up a form into several steps can make the tasks a bit more approachable and organized for the user. It is also better to start with similar questions. If you ask complex questions right off the bat, people are more likely to abandon the form altogether. If they are at the end of the form when the user is about to finish anyway, they will likely work harder for a more complex question after having done every other part of the form.  I have personally experienced forms in which I am immediately discouraged from filling out the entirety of it when the first question I see is long and complex. </p> 

            <p>Moreover, users like clear instructions and labels. This means making sure every fill in box is clearly visible, and labeled correctly. This also means having clear, easy to understand instructions. Overall, I enjoyed the article and it gave me some tips for creating a form that users will enjoy filling out. </p>
