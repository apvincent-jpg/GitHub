            <p>In the article <i>20 Best Practices for Form Design</i>, Salim Ansari discusses 20 best practices that boost a form’s usability. I thought this article was very helpful, as it solidified ideas I already understood as a user. For instance, I learned it is important to not put too many fields in a form, as it can turn viewers away from the important questions, since people don’t like filling out long forms. This has been true for me, and I am usually more drawn to forms with short questions. </p>
    
            <p>Furthermore, I learned that chunking up a form into several steps can make the tasks a bit more approachable and organized for the user. It is also better to start with similar questions. If you ask complex questions right off the bat, people are more likely to abandon the form altogether. If they are at the end of the form when the user is about to finish anyway, they will likely work harder for a more complex question after having done every other part of the form.  I have personally experienced forms in which I am immediately discouraged from filling out the entirety of it when the first question I see is long and complex. </p> 

            <p>Moreover, users like clear instructions and labels. This means making sure every fill in box is clearly visible, and labeled correctly. This also means having clear, easy to understand instructions. Overall, I enjoyed the article and it gave me some tips for creating a form that users will enjoy filling out. </p>
